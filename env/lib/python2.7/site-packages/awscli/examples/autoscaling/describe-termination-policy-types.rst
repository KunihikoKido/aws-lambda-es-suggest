**To describe termination policy types**

The following ``describe-termination-policy-types`` command returns the available termination policy types::

	aws autoscaling describe-termination-policy-types

The output of this command is a JSON block that lists the types of termination policies, similar to the following::

  {
    "TerminationPolicyTypes": [
        "ClosestToNextInstanceHour",
        "Default",
        "NewestInstance",
        "OldestInstance",
        "OldestLaunchConfiguration"
    ]
  }

For more information, see the `How Termination Policies Work`_ section in the Configure Instance Termination Policy for Your Auto Scaling Group topic, in the *Auto Scaling Developer Guide*.
